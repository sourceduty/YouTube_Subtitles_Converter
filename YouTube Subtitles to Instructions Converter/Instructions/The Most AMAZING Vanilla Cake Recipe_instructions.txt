How to Make the Only Vanilla Cake Recipe You'll Ever Need

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Prepare two eight-inch cake pans by greasing the sides and bottom with butter. Place a circle of parchment paper at the bottom of each pan.
3. Alternatively, you can use three six-inch cake pans.
4. In a bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups (280 grams) of all-purpose flour, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and 2 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder. Sift the mixture and set it aside.
5. In a stand mixer, cream 3/4 cup (170 grams) of room temperature unsalted butter until smooth.
6. While the butter is creaming, crack three eggs into a small bowl, ensuring no shells get into the mix.
7. Add 1 2/3 cups (333 grams) of granulated sugar to the creamed butter and mix until fluffy for about three minutes.
8. Add the eggs into the mixture one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.
9. Mix in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vanilla extract.
10. Alternately, add the dry flour mixture and 1 cup of room temperature buttermilk to the butter mixture, starting and ending with the dry ingredients.
11. Mix on low speed and avoid overmixing the batter. There should still be some flour visible.
12. Finish mixing by hand with a spatula to bring everything together without overworking the batter.
13. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, ensuring about 600 grams per pan.
14. Tap the pans on the counter to remove air bubbles and ensure even baking.
15. Bake the cakes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
16. Let the cakes cool completely before assembling.
17. Prepare a batch of simple vanilla buttercream frosting.
18. Once cooled, assemble the cake by placing one layer on a cake plate, adding a generous layer of frosting, and repeating with the second layer.
19. Optional: Apply a thin crumb coat of frosting to the assembled cake before the final frosting layer for a smoother finish.
20. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream, smoothing it with an offset spatula.
21. Decorate the cake with a spiral pattern using a rounded tip spatula or any suitable implement.
22. Finish by adding some sprinkles for decoration.
23. Enjoy the delicious vanilla cake with your family and friends!

Note: Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature for best results and handle the cake layers gently to prevent breakage.
