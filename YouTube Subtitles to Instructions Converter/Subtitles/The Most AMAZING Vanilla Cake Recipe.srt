Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen,

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,230
where I, John Kanell, teach you

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,820
how to make delicious homemade dishes

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,360
to share with your family and friends.

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,930
This cake will be ready
before you know it,

10
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,360
so let's get started.

11
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,360
First off, set your oven to 350

12
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,340
and prep your two eight-inch pans.

13
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,290
You could also make this

14
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,800
with three six-inch pans if you want.

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,791
Going to give the sides
a nice bit of butter,

16
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,200
a little for the bottom,

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,210
and then just place
that sheet right there.

18
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,070
A circle of parchment
paper is your insurance

19
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,050
for no broken or cracked
cakes when they release;

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,370
that is heartbreak.

21
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,230
For this cake, we're using 2 1/2 cups

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,550
or 280 grams of all-purpose flour.

23
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,130
This cake will be the best

24
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,920
if you measure your flour the right way,

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,070
which is with a scale.

26
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,670
If you're not using a
scale, fluff the flour up

27
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,040
and then sprinkle it
into your measuring cup.

28
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,430
Now we're adding 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt

29
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,040
and 2 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder.

30
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,624
Now we're going to sift
it up and whisk it out.

31
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:04,457
(chuckles)

32
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:06,670
Now we're going to sift
it out and whisk it up.

33
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,503
Set it aside.

34
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:12,786
All right, let's get that stand mixer.

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,750
For this cake, we're using 3/4 of a cup

36
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,090
or 170 grams of room
temperature unsalted butter.

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,220
And room temperature means
you can press into the butter,

38
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,910
and it'll yield to the touch.

39
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,260
We're going to cream the butter up

40
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,260
so it is nice and smooth
before we add the sugar.

41
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,440
And while we cream it up,

42
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,700
we can crack three eggs into a small bowl.

43
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,600
You do not want any shells in
your delicious vanilla cake.

44
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:40,559
(upbeat music)

45
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,980
Our butter is nice and creamed up.

46
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,000
You can always scrape the
bowl down a little bit

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,410
before you add another ingredient in.

48
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,590
We want a homogenous mixture.

49
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,130
Now we're going to add 1 2/3
cups of granulated sugar;

50
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,400
that's 333 grams.

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,880
Add it in while it's mixing.

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,130
Increase to high and
get it nice and fluffy.

53
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,413
Mix for three minutes.

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,870
It looks fluffy on top,

55
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,720
but not so much on the bottom,

56
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,500
so we're going to scrape it down.

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,600
Look at this, this is not fluffy.

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,130
Just scrape it down and mix it up.

59
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,170
Once it's light and fluffy,

60
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,070
we're going to add three
eggs in one at a time.

61
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,240
Let the first one incorporate
before you add the next.

62
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,260
Otherwise, you'll have an egg soup on top

63
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,810
and solid butter on the bottom.

64
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,793
Last egg.

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Now it's time for a tablespoon
or 15 ML of a nice vanilla.

66
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,890
This is the primary flavor in the cake,

67
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,593
so, mm, don't skimp on it if possible.

68
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,403
In you go.

69
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,047
The smell is amazing, mm.

70
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,950
One last scrape down,

71
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,120
and then we're going
to add the dry mixture

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,713
and the buttermilk in alternating batches.

73
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,700
Bring that flour back.

74
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,150
I also measured out one cup of buttermilk.

75
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,670
And just like with the eggs, if possible,

76
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,130
everything should be room temperature.

77
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,220
You don't want to add ice-cold
ingredients into an oven,

78
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,700
because then the cake
won't bake really evenly.

79
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,210
You want it to bake nicely
throughout so it's pretty flat.

80
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,110
If you don't, you're going to
have a big dome on the top,

81
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,510
and the edges will be burnt.

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,910
Okay, this looks beautiful.

83
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,110
Really loose, light-colored mixture.

84
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,180
If it looks a little
bit broken, don't worry;

85
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,930
it's all going to come
together once we add the flour.

86
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,803
As long as it's homogenous,
you're in the right.

87
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,940
We're going to mix also on lowest speed.

88
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,450
You do not want to overmix cake batter.

89
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,650
That will get you in trouble.

90
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,350
Just sprinkle it in,

91
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,240
let it mix a bit,

92
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,940
and then add in, mm,
1/3 of the buttermilk.

93
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,900
Repeat.

94
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,280
We're going to mix this
until it's almost combined.

95
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,350
I do not want to see it fully mixed in,

96
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,450
because we're going to finish
the cake batter off by hand.

97
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,540
Right now, there's a
lot of chunks of flour.

98
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,240
Probably some butter
hanging out here or there.

99
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,210
But we're going to use our spatula

100
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,010
and bring this all together.

101
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,260
If you overmixed your cake
batter, it'll look perfect

102
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,550
when comes out of the oven,

103
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,870
but as soon as it cools
down, it'll contract,

104
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,440
it'll be kind of gummy and tough,

105
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,670
and just not melt in your mouth amazing.

106
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,850
You do not want to develop the gluten.

107
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,620
This is ready to go into our pans,

108
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,010
so let's get those out.

109
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,930
You should have just about 600
grams of cake batter per pan.

110
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,520
So you can use a scale or
eyeball it, either way.

111
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,000
I love using my scale.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,580
I'm only mentioning it
because I actually get

113
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,890
a lot of questions on how many
grams of cake batter per pan,

114
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,940
so that's the answer.

115
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,283
Give your pans a quick tap

116
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,400
just to get any big air bubbles out.

117
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,693
And you can also tap the
sides to help them level out.

118
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,830
Then they go into the oven at 350.

119
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,830
But I'm going to use cake strips

120
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,240
because I like my layers
to be perfectly flat

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,583
with no trimming, because
that's wasted cake.

122
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,540
350 for about 30 minutes.

123
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,520
While my cake was cooling,
I whipped up a batch

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,470
of my simple vanilla buttercream.

125
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,780
Click up here for that recipe.

126
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,013
It is delicious and so easy.

127
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,870
Before you use any buttercream,

128
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,570
just use your spatula to
press any air bubbles out

129
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,470
so it decorates up nice and smooth.

130
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,350
Transfer your frosting to a piping bag,

131
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,930
and let's get to work.

132
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,740
I'm working directly on a cake plate.

133
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,913
Just add one dot of
buttercream on the bottom.

134
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:29,140
Place that cake layer in the center.

135
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,973
We're going to cover this

136
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:33,770
with a generous layer
of buttercream frosting.

137
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,670
Give it a quick smooth
just to even it out.

138
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,393
Pop that second layer on.

139
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,330
Sometimes you'll want to do a crumb coat,

140
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,210
because cakes can be crumby,

141
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,390
but you don't really need to.

142
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,910
So I'll show you.

143
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,070
All you'll want to do is cover the cake

144
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,030
in one layer of buttercream,

145
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,180
and then you can smooth it out.

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,560
It's gonna look perfect.

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,550
The key is really for the cake to be cool.

148
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,860
Use an offset spatula

149
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,130
and just smooth the top of the cake out.

150
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,430
Smooth the side.

151
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,030
This cake actually looks fine to me,

152
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,740
but I'm gonna finish it off

153
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,740
with a really easy spiral pattern.

154
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,340
All you need is a rounded tip spatula

155
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,970
or any implement and a cake
turntable if you have one.

156
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,260
Otherwise, smooth it out or swoop it up.

157
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,060
Let's finish this off with
a sprinkle of sprinkles.

158
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,210
To the sprinkle drawer.

159
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,789
(chimes chime)

160
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,250
Confetti sprinkles are
one of my favorite things.

161
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,500
Just a few on the edge is all
