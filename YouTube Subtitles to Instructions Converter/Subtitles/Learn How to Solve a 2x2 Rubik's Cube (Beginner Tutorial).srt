1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
hey guys today I'll teach you how to

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,300
solve the 2x2 Rubik's Cube using a

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,740
beginner method so the first thing we'll

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,779
do is build an entire layer on any color

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,280
but I'm going to use white for this

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,500
tutorial and what I mean by a layer is

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,240
not only have this face salt and I'll be

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,340
white but also have these colors around

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,900
it line up so once your cube is

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,039
scrambled I'm just going to start with

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,080
white and I see white white white white

12
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,539
so there are four options of which one I

13
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,580
want to start with so I can just say I'm

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,779
going to start with this one it doesn't

15
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,039
matter which one you choose and then

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,080
just put it on the bottom like this so

17
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,760
that is going to be my first solved

18
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,380
piece so once you choose which one you

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
want to be solved look for white pieces

20
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,980
in the top layer so for example we have

21
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,260
this one over here so remember to keep

22
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,360
this on the bottom at all times this

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,300
white piece has green and red also on it

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,340
look at your original soft piece and we

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,620
have red and blue so the color they have

26
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,079
in common is red because of that I want

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,420
this piece to be next to the red here in

28
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,739
other words this piece is going to be

29
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,140
solved when it is over here so now what

30
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to do is turn the top layer so

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,280
that it goes directly above the spot I

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,539
said it was going to go in to because

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,460
it's got red here and this red here so

34
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,140
it's going to go next to it here now to

35
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,460
move this one from the top into the

36
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,840
bottom make sure you're holding it in

37
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,280
your right hand like this not in your

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,260
left hand and then repeat this sequence

39
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,880
of moves make sure you get the sequence

40
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,140
of moves down because it's going to be

41
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,939
very important later on as well so hold

42
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,680
your left hand like this and hold your

43
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,939
right hand like this with your thumb on

44
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,400
the bottom then repeat after me turn the

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,540
right side up

46
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,520
push the top with your right hand turn

47
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
the right side down push this off with

48
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,479
your left hand so you're going to repeat

49
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,340
that until this corner is solved so do

50
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,140
we see white on the bottom here no we

51
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,920
don't so we're going to repeat

52
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,579
and this is white on the bottom but it's

53
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,900
not the piece we were looking for as you

54
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,579
can see that's not the red piece so

55
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,360
we're going to go again

56
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,740
and there it is now we have a soft piece

57
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,479
so what we can do is keep repeating this

58
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,040
so we look in the top layer for white

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,439
pieces we see white here and this has

60
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,659
orange and blue on it so look at what

61
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,520
we've already solved we have blue red

62
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,380
and green so the color they have in

63
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,640
common is blue

64
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,560
so that means this one must go next to

65
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,659
the blue piece over here

66
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,100
so we're going to move the top until

67
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,899
it's directly above that spot

68
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,879
hold it in the right hand and then

69
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,500
repeat those four moves until this one

70
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,819
is in here

71
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,040
so once

72
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,480
and nope the White's not on the bottom

73
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,340
yet twice three times four times five

74
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,840
times sometimes it takes up to five

75
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
times and then now it's in there and

76
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,540
just make sure the colors here match as

77
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,160
well and for example the last piece here

78
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,720
we find a white piece and a top layer

79
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,640
it's got orange and green so well

80
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,080
there's only one last spot for it so

81
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
we're just going to move it in here and

82
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,720
repeat the four moves until it's in

83
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,900
there

84
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,840
and there we go there's the first layer

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,459
one situation you can run into is your

86
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,019
first layer is not done but there's no

87
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,239
more white pieces in the top layer so in

88
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,560
that case it might just be in the bottom

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
layer and how to remove it into the top

90
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
layer so you can do what you normally do

91
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,540
is just put it on the right side like

92
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,000
this and repeat the four moves that

93
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,379
moves it up into the top layer without

94
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,000
breaking your progress and then once

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,260
it's in the top layer you can just put

96
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,519
it into the spot it should go into

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,319
normally so once you finish the first

98
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,700
layer and check that all the sides here

99
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,900
are the correct then we're going to move

100
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,239
on to the last layer so focus on any

101
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
particular bottom layer piece I'm going

102
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,239
to choose this one which has red and

103
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,440
green on it but it doesn't matter which

104
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,720
one you pick then try and solve the

105
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
corner that goes directly above it so

106
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,480
we're going to turn the top layer until

107
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,519
we see red and green and it's this one

108
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,620
this one has yellow red and green now

109
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,000
we're going to check every other piece

110
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
on the top and see if they're in the

111
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,640
correct spot and count how many we have

112
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,440
so here we have red blue and this one's

113
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,900
red blue so this one's correct blue

114
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,879
orange not blue orange so this one's

115
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,519
incorrect green orange not green orange

116
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,379
so this one's also incorrect so in this

117
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,299
case we happen to have two that are in

118
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,860
the right spot so your goal for this

119
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,360
step is to get all four in the correct

120
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,459
spot if they all were in the right spot

121
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,080
already then you're done this step but

122
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400
if you cannot get all four in the

123
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
correct spot then you only want one in

124
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,819
the correct spot not two like I have

125
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,680
here so for example in this one I could

126
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
just do another turn instead and we find

127
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,580
that only this one is in the correct

128
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,260
spot and every other one is in the wrong

129
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
spot so this is good now sometimes you

130
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,159
won't be able to get all four and you

131
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,959
won't be able to get only one in that

132
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,220
case you'll just do what I'm about to

133
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,439
show from anywhere but if you only get

134
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,180
one in the correct spot then you want to

135
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,680
hold it on the front right like this

136
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,299
next what you do is this algorithm

137
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,920
that's quite easy to memorize because it

138
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,840
has a nice pattern to it so turn the top

139
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
with your right hand turn the right side

140
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,639
up now repeat this with your left hand

141
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,220
top with your left hand left side up now

142
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,959
the exact same thing but all downwards

143
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,520
this time so top of your right hand

144
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,740
right side down top with your left hand

145
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,720
left side down so once you've done this

146
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
this one should still be in the correct

147
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,360
spot but every other one should have

148
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
moved so check if they're in the right

149
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,660
spots and they're not so that means

150
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,220
we're just going to repeat it again

151
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,620
top of the right right side up top with

152
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,660
the left left side up and then all down

153
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,180
top of the right right side down top

154
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,520
with left left side down and now we

155
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,680
check them all again and they're all in

156
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,479
the correct spot so what we do is see

157
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,220
that okay all the top pieces have yellow

158
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,199
on them here which means yellow is what

159
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,120
goes on the top here so what we're going

160
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,460
to do is turn it upside down and hold

161
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,100
any unsolved piece here at the bottom

162
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,259
right and so we're going to repeat the

163
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,340
four moves that I showed in the

164
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,740
beginning until the yellow here faces

165
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,660
the bottom so I'm going to do it once

166
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,020
like this

167
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,400
twice

168
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,139
three times

169
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,820
four times

170
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,860
and there we go now once this one is

171
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,479
solved we're going to go on to the next

172
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
corner but instead of just rotating the

173
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,139
whole Cube to go to the next Corner this

174
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,880
will mess up your whole Cube so instead

175
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,860
we're just going to stay facing the same

176
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,199
side but then turn the bottom only to

177
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,060
grab the next Corner over

178
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,380
then we're going to repeat until this

179
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,100
corner is solved

180
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,539
there we go it's solved and then we move

181
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,979
on to the next one

182
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,639
and repeat

183
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,680
and there it is then that's the whole

184
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,539
thing lastly if you want to get faster

185
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,220
links are in the description for more

186
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,139
advanced methods thanks for watching and

187
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll see you guys next time hey guys

188
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,620
this video will be example solves for

189
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,419
the 2x2 beginner method so I'm going to

190
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,680
start by looking for white pieces to

191
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,819
make the white layer and I can start

192
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,500
with any piece I want put that on the

193
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,840
bottom and then this is green and orange

194
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,280
so I'll look in the top layer for

195
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,720
another white piece and it's this one

196
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,380
this one's
